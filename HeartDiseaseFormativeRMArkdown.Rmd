The dataset used in this report is available in [The Scottish Health and Social Care Open Data platform](https://www.opendata.nhs.scot/dataset/scottish-heart-disease-statistics/resource/748e2065-b447-4b75-99bd-f17f26f3eaef)

### EDA

This set collects data for four different kind of diagnosis, named as: **"Coronary Heart Disease",
"Heart Attack", "Heart Failure" and "Angina"**

```{r}
#code to find out how many different diagnosis are in the data set:
activity %>%
  distinct(diagnosis) %>%
  kable()
```

Patients are assigned one of the following age range groups: **"0-44 years", "45-64 years", "65-74 years", "75plus years", "All", "under75 years"**

```{r}
#To find out how many age groups are in the data set:
activity %>%
  distinct(age_group) %>%
  kable()
```



## Total number of patients discharged in 2021 **age 0-44** 

Most common heart disease for this age group is Coronary Heart Disease, followed by Heart Attack, Heart Failure and Angina.

```{r}
activity_44 <- activity %>%
  select(year, age_group, sex, diagnosis, number_of_discharges)%>%
  mutate(heart_disease = as.factor(diagnosis)) %>% 
  filter(age_group=="0-44 years")%>%
  filter(year==2021) %>%
  group_by(heart_disease) %>%
  summarize(total_44=sum(number_of_discharges, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  arrange(desc(total_44))
kable(activity_44)

```


## Total number of patients discharged in 2021 **age 45-64 years**

Most common heart disease for this age group is Coronary Heart Disease, followed by Heart Attack, Heart Failure and Angina.

```{r}
activity_64 <- activity %>%
  select(year, age_group, sex, diagnosis, number_of_discharges) %>%
  mutate(heart_disease = as.factor(diagnosis)) %>%
  filter(age_group=="45-64 years") %>%
  filter(year==2021) %>%
  group_by(heart_disease) %>%
  summarize(total_64 = sum(number_of_discharges, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  arrange(desc(total_64))
kable(activity_64)

```



## Total number of patients discharged in 2021 **age 65-74 years**

Most common heart disease for this age group is Coronary Heart Disease, followed by Heart Attack, Heart Failure and Angina.

```{r}
activity_74 <- activity %>%
  select(year, age_group, sex, diagnosis, number_of_discharges) %>%
  mutate(heart_disease = as.factor(diagnosis)) %>%
  filter(age_group=="65-74 years" & year==2021) %>%
  filter(year==2021) %>%
  group_by(heart_disease) %>%
  summarize(total_74 = sum(number_of_discharges, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  arrange(desc(total_74))
kable(activity_74)

```



## Total number of patients discharged in 2021 **age 75plus years** 

Most common heart disease for this age group is Coronary Heart Disease, followed by Heart Failure, Heart Attack and Angina.

```{r}
activity_75plus <- activity %>%
  select(year, age_group, sex, diagnosis, number_of_discharges) %>%
  mutate(heart_disease = as.factor(diagnosis)) %>%
  filter(age_group=="75plus years") %>%
  filter(year==2021) %>%
  group_by(heart_disease) %>%
  summarize(total_75plus = sum(number_of_discharges, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  arrange(desc(total_75plus))
kable(activity_75plus)

```

## Ploting the data for each age group 

limits of the y axis are fixed so the four plots can  be compared:

```{r}
ggplot(activity_44, aes(x=heart_disease, y=total_44)) + geom_col(fill="darkgreen", alpha=0.6) + ylim(0,145000) + ggtitle("Common heart diseases in Scotland for age group 0-44 (Year 2021)")+ ylab("Number of patients") + xlab("Heart disease")
```


```{r}
ggplot(activity_64, aes(x=heart_disease, y=total_64)) + geom_col(fill="orange", alpha=0.6) + ylim(0,145000) + 
  ggtitle("Common heart diseases in Scotland for age group 45-64 (Year 2021)") + ylab("Number of patients") + xlab("Heart disease")
```


```{r}
ggplot(activity_74, aes(x=heart_disease, y=total_74)) + geom_col(fill="red", alpha=0.6) + ylim(0,145000)+ 
  ggtitle("Common heart diseases in Scotland for age group 65-74 (Year 2021)") + ylab("Number of patients") + xlab("Heart disease")
```

```{r}
ggplot(activity_75plus, aes(x=heart_disease, y=total_75plus)) + geom_col(fill="brown", alpha=0.6) + ylim(0,145000)+ 
  ggtitle("Common heart diseases in Scotland for age group 75+ (Year 2021)") + ylab("Number of patients") + xlab("Heart disease")
```
